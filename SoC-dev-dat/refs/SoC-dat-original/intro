After having given away nearly all your money and completed the papers and codes, at least you're staring at the ship awaiting you behind the hangar walls! Your wonder must show and the old Spacer shrugs while he looks at you. Finally, he speaks, as if revealing a secret known to only himself:

"Let me tell you a thing... the night sky always draws our eyes. People look up with a question, or in wonder, and sometimes with a dream: to venture forth among the stars.

And venture you'll do! You'll probably meet more than you expect! We Spacers come from the known universe's six main species. You'll explore thousands of systems, land on thousands of stations and hundreds of worlds. From now, you're free in the Infinity!

Another thing... you may have been told to not talk to strangers. Forget that! In space, cooperation is the key to survival. We're building up a Spacers' way of thinking, born from the harshness of spacefaring. We value cooperation and respect for life, and he who abides by our standards, we'll help him at any time, in any system.

But beware! Many factions threaten our ideal, be they bricks-for-brains staters or lawless pirates. The States protect us, but also enslave us with regulations and paperwork. On the other side, they can't patrol every system. Many ruthless people try to get advantage of that and so, piracy is rampant.

But we Spacers are ferociously attached to our freedom. We would neither hesitate to fight pirates if need be, nor would we readily accept too much State control."

He then keeps a few moments' silence, sharply hands you the papers and memory key, gestures towards the door that slides open, then turns around to the monitor and says bluntly:

"But you know, that's only my view. I'm just an old Spacer and to me, you're still another dirtballer. If you really wanna become one of us, now fly away!"

When you climb the ramp into the hull and enter the cockpit, a message is waiting for you.

"Sorry for being blunt. Will fly no more and can't stand staring at its decaying. All I wish is, you'll be worthy of it. It's damn good ship, that'll take care of you. I wish you both to fly long and far, Spacer!"

All of a sudden, you feel sorry for him. What is a Spacer without a ship to fly? But there is nothing you can do for him just now. You feverishly crash through your first real takeoff check-list and blast off from planetside into orbit, then towards free space.
