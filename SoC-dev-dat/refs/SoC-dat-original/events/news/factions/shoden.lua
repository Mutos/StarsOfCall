			desc = "Self-proclaimed Master-writer Sshiilyada Lalnesh issued a new crap, on which he writes piracy is not a means for natural selection. This goes against everything we Sshaads know so well. He even quotes such heretics as Aareli ud Aragwedyr, the traitor who lives with Humans and Rithai on a world made for sshaad-only mastery, and the alien so-called sociologist Eorath ud Orthid-Irilia, who betrayed the only true values of honor through battle her Rith people share with us. Smuggled editions were seized and burned in several places. All true Sshaads are to report immediately to their Hierarchs if they happen to spot similar subversive writings."

Baartish High-Masters protested, but Third Warmaster Almath Elshin Sshilaan dismissed the accusation as \"telltales of a feeble state, contaminated by Shapeshifters pacifism\". He then reaffirmed that \"Shoden ships are at home anywhere in the Sshaad Sphere\"."
