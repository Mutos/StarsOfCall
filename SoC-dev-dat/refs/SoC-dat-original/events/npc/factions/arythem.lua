		"Of course I know the K'Rinns are not Na'imsh. But I can never see one without remembering what my elders tald me of their sufferings. I'm sorry, I just can't!",
		"We always have been sturdier, even back in the two-clans times. Have no doubt, we are the true heirs to the Arrhan Empire!",
		"Revolutions ago, I went to the black Mountains. There I lived with Free Adrimai after they saved my life. This changed my view on them. They are not dead. They live and should live alongside with us.",
		"We lost the Fringe Wars, but that's past history now. These traditionalist fools shouldn't have taken us there in the first place, just because K'Rinns merely looked like Na'imsh!",
		"These damned ghosts and their na'imsh-like allies! All bodysnatchers and deathmongers! And now that new species, Pupeteers, they call them! We've seen enough horrors in our lives! We should stay within the Rith and kill all these monsters, should they ever approach our space!"
