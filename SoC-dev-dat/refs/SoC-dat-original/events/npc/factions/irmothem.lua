	msg_lore["Irmothem Clan"] = {"We've always been merchants, as far as the legends tell. That's what I am, I explore, I keep the people happy by selling them what they need! That's a life of honor.",
										 "The Irilia and  Arythem alike are great explorers, but we Irmothem stay firm on our ground, and we're gonna survive all this turmoil!",
										 "Rithai Kemae, they call themsleves, but what honor do they have left? Maybe they were Idrimarai once, before they allied with the insects...",
										 "I don't understand why the Irilia and Ayrthem do care about the ghosts. They're only ghosts, after all. Let them alone and you'll be quiet!",
										 "As for honor, the Gham Garri are more trustful than the Rithai Kemae! They really fight for the Rith.",
										 "I've traded with an ex-Adrim, and I can tell you, she's as honorable as any regular Rith. She should have been a Thisk by now, but of course, we Irmothem are traditionalists, so she'll never acquire any status, even if she saved half the Rith from sure death.",
										 "We lost the Fringe Wars, but that's past history now. We've got our own contacts and we don't need the Commonwealth for that!"
