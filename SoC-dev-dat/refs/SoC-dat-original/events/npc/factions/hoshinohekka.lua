		"I'm still waiting for my pilot license application to get through to the Hekka. Oh well, it's only been half a cycle, I just have to be patient.",
		"Here, we call pilots \"hayajin\". It's an Oljap wordplay between \"IA-implanted people\" and \"speed freak\"",
		"Some oldtimers by there still speak Oljap, like their Earthian ancestors from that small island.",
		"Between you and me, the laws the Council passes can get really ridiculous! They rebuilt a Surveyor Station around Tempest, for instance! Who except these Persephone madmen would think about attacking that ball of crap?",
		"Don't pay attention to the naysayers. The Hekka are still as strong as they were at Eldorado. Have you ever seen a Fortress releasing its full fighters contingent? I doubt even these Core braggers would stand up against one."
