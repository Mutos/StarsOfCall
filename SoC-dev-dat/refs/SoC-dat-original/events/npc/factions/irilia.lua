	msg_lore["Irilia Clan"] = {"Our Clan is split on the Adrim issue. To me, the ghosts should just be removed to an empty space, and the next generation should be allowed to get back in the world of the living, if they can prove their honor!",
										 "We never should have allied with the K'Rinns, and much less with the Planetarists. The Clan is fast losing its values and rithness.",
										 "Revolutions ago, I used to see Adrimai as mere ghostly shapes. Since I've become a Spacer, it changed my whole perceptions. Now, they are nearly real to my eyes.",
										 "We conquered Great Irilia using diversity of independent tribes as our greatest strenght. I'm confident in our ability to do the same again and again.",
										 "It's a good thing we open up to other species. Our old traditions from the conquest of Great irilia were daydreams of past honor. Here we'll be able to regain true greatness!"
