  <description>This military Purr Sphere is a part of the Doorkeeper Quintet, a set of five stations protecting the only system linking to The Cradle. This is the only example in the Pupeteer Sphere of a heavily militarized system. The stations have been built after the first official contact with the Rithai, when the Stars-Strider-7 incident and the general geopolitical situation became known. Faced with all these aggressive species, the Pupeteers decided to built a system-wide buffer zone to protect their only exit to the jump network.
