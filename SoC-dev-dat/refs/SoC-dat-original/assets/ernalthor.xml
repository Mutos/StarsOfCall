  <description>This forest world is the latest Arythem planetary colony. It was originally to become a co-colony with Sshaads and Shapeshifters, but was a little too far from the Long Link to Baartish and did not have much success. There are still a few complementarist danebs along the eastern continent shores, living in quite a good harmony with the rithai colonists.

With the opening of the Sigma Sector and given the hostility of Jaltha to non-Rithai, Ernalthor has become the last meeting point of explorers heading for the oft-rumoured purgatorian remains. K'Rinn and sshaad settlements have recently been created, and negociations are under way with the Planetarist Alliance for human settlements. It seems a new potential is dawning for a rebirth and extension of the original co-colony concept.
