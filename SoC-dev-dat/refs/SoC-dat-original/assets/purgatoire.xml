  <description>This planet was the cradleworld of the sentient species currently called Purgatorians. They destroyed themselves some 8000 years before the first of the current major spacegoing species set up to space.

When the Ashioto ("Footsteps") system was first explored by Humans, several Policorpos engaged in a very dirty war to get a hand on the powerful technological remnants lying on the planet. They used tactical atomics, heavy cyborgization, highly illegal hypnotics and endoctrination, and even dared to use recovered purgatorian technologies they did not fully understand, ending up with a number of local cataclysms. The name "Purgatoire" itself was coined by the suffering troops on all sides of that merciless war.

During the conflict, an overwhelming number of soldiers revolted over the years. They formed an independent army that allied with Harushita, the cleanest of the policorpos engaged on the main war. They forcibly struck a general cease-fire, then a peace among the expeditionary forces. Later on, Harushita joined the then-secret Planetarist Alliance to defeat the other policorpos, whom they thought had failed to keep their honour and integrity, and the Purgatoire Irregulars became the core of the Alliance Military.

Over the course of history, a number of further incidents involved Humans, K'Rinns and Sshaads with runaway purgatorian techs recovered from various places, nearly always ending in disaster. K'Rinn research teams also demonstrated that the Purgatorians were the Til'kk'Rantk, the "Flying Gods" who once visited H'Rkann millenia ago. They were responsible for the flawed gengineering made on the Ha'Tinkar, that ended up with that innocent people being wiped out by a terrible disease a few years after they encountered the K'Rinns.

Currently, the planet is Under Edict from the ad-hoc Ashioto Cluster Authority that was formed for managing the technological remnants studies without taking further risks of catastrophs. It is basically a joint organisation between the Central League and the K'Rinn Council, with other States being represented through Commonwealth Delegates.
