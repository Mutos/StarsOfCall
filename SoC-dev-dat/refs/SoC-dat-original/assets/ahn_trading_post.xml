  <description>This station is an independant trading hub, in other words, a smuggling platform. It was built by a small sshaad-human concern, betting trade would rise between the Core League and Shoden Clusters after the Baatal-Bamara Incident. However, the Shoden blockade was never lifted and the tentative trade route never gained much success. Soon, blockade runners from the border began to use it as a link to the main Core League trade routes. So Ahn Trading Post slowly faded from the official maps and appeared on less official ones...
