  <description>This barren planet was colonized by the Shoden as an outpost. However, the colonists quickly discovered that the hidden, underground network of lakes and rivers was far more extensive that the geosatellite said at first. The population thus exploded and the planet is now considered one of the most promising shoden colonies to date. It is also viewed as a stronghold of Shoden influence, as its underground cities are virtually inexpungnable.
