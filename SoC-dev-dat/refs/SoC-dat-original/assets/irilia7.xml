  <description>One of the most successful Irilia colonies, Irilia-7 was initially established by Irilia-1 people in search of further expansion. The oceanic world proved to be a great reservoir of marine life which was, despite a low biocompatibility, mostly harmless for skaraean life.

Today's population is a basic mix of Irilia-1 and Irilia-4 stock, with the addition of a notable proportion of people from other oceanic Irilia worlds. The steady climate and benign ecosystems provide for a great quality of life, if lacklust by rithai warlike standards. Its proximity with Ka'Ralt and k'rinn space have also attracted a steadily growing k'rinn population, under the first cooperation treaty of Ka'Ralt with a non-k'rinn world.

The mix of populations with very different views on life has prompted some concern in the beginning, but now things have settled into a "live and let live" modus vivendi. There is still some opposition between pro-Gham Garri and pro-Free Adrimai but, if the system sometimes sees armed encounters between the opposed factions, the planetside population doesn't actively take sides.
