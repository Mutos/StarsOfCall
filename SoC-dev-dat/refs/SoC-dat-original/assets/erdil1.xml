  <description>This aquatic moon, very near its parent gas giant, has been settled by Clan Erdil, using pupeteers-inspired biotechs. Its high-amplitude tides that daily wash hundreds of square kilometers spawned a variety of tideline animals and plants, whose biocompatibility with skaraen life is excellent. So Erdil-1 and its tidal fishing platforms have quickly become a major supplier of seafood, renowned throughout Irmothem space. The magnificent vista of planet Alarane also did help to make the small fishing moon a first-class tourist resort.

However, being close to Irilia space and a byproduct of the progressive and rebellious Erdil culture, the planet is also known as a foothold of pro-Adrim movements in Irmothem space, and regarded with disdain, fear and sometimes hatred by the most traditionalist Idrimarai. Mainstream noblerithai see it as a lab, worthy of attention to bring up new ways to control the Free Adrimai, but expendable if it were to reveal itself a threat.
