  <description>The station was originally a small outpost established by an independant trader for storing goods. It was vastly expanded when Vigma-4's rings were put into exploitation. However, and despite the rings' continued mining, the so-called "Vigma gold rush" didn't last long. The small asteroid fell from most memories, exept those of spacers who have in the meantime come to use it as a relay between Alliance, Core and HnH. That's what it still is now.
