  <description>This independant station is the entry point for the dangerous Delta Sector. In the past, it had a protection contract with the Wurth Interstellar Concern. When it was revealed the Concern used this contract to cover up preparation for creating a new state along with local mafias, the contract was replaced by a force made up of independant mercenary squadrons.</description>
