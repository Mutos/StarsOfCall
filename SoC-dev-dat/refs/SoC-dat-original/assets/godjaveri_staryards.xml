 Lupe Godjaveri's own staryards, originally only a small drydock to manufacture on demand the Niglo-class smuggling ship. It has been built on orbit around Dwarves' Tunnels, which abundant raw metals it can use at a low price. It has then expanded to become a flourishing station that builds and repairs many smugglers' ships. It is currently managed by Lupe Godjaveri herself and her only child, her daughter Azra.
