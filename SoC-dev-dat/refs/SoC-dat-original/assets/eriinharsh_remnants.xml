  <description>No-one knows how this ages-old alien ship hull got encrusted into an asteroid, but it has been identified as a probable purgatorian remnant.

It has long been scrapped of anything valuable and converted to an exploration base, in hope of discovering a second Ashioto, but only a few remnants have so far been found in the nearby systems.

As currently the Aan sector is locked out by pirate presence, exploration has long dwindled to a stop and it unlikely to see it resume anytime soon. All that is left is a few scientists, mainly Sshaads and some K'Rinns, who still believe in the discoveries they could make there.
