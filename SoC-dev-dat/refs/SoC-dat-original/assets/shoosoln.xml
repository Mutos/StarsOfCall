  <description>Shoosoln is an ore-rich moon around a gas giant. Located in the local lifezone, it did already possess some lifeforms, up to amphibians.

It was tshiaarshformed by the Baartish for its mining riches and the process worked well, quickly allowing Sshaad colonists to live outside the domes. The settlers being a traditionalist lot, the original charter upheld daneb independance and anarchism, and of course a masterless society.

When the colony demanded to affiliate itself to the Daneb Anarchs, Baartish, not willing to disrupt ore production and confident of its alliance with the Anarchs, agreed without much ado.

When Complementarism began to spread into the Baartish, the Anarchs were fervent supporters of the new ideology and naturally, Shoosoln hosted at first a few Hives exfltrated from their cradle world, then a growing number of hived danebs. Now it is seen as a model of a Complementarist world.
