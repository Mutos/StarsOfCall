  <description>While colder than most Irilia worlds, Irilia-9 has extensive forest lands and a large oceanic mass. It is famous for its polar caps and its exceptional, entirely natural well-moonedness.

However, the appearances have proved deceptive and, with a low biocompatibility of the native ecosystems and only small ore deposits and no asteroids ring in-system, the planet has a hard time keeping its planned pace of development, and even staying autonomous. Even today, it is still dependant of the neighboring systems for its basic sustenance.
