  <description>This small refueling station orbiting around the Ainal gas giant was originally built by a group of nomad masters who called themselves the Iish Leenan, which means "Travelling Explorers" in common Baartish.

However, when exploration ships found out a nearby jump point, which was found to be a new doorway to the Long Link, Baartish Intersystems stepped in and turned the station into a border surveyor and trading outpost.

Despite all the money invested, it was still quite away from main routes to planets and never developed any regular trade. It instead became a smuggling place and was soon known as "the back door to the Long Link".

With the prison ship that got trapped inside a purgatorian planetoid emerging into Leenan space, the station suddenly came into the spotlight. Media coverage soon died out and, while Jaltha became the official entry point to the so-called Sigma Sector, Leenan soon became an unofficial starting-block for the smugglers' race to the new purgatorian treasure hold.
