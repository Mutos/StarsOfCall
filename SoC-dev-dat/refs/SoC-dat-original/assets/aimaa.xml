  <description>Aimaa is a recently settled Baartish world, the first co-colony based on Complementarist concepts and a contract with the K'Rinn Council. On a nice world, although a little cold for K'Rinns and Sshaads, but unique for its unusually good biocompatibility to sshaad, shapeshifter and k'rinn ecosystems alike.

The colony has been strongly advertised and has started with an already large complement of settlers. This public relations +.operation prompted a dispute with the nearby Ets'aalin planet in the same system, as the Aimaa Colonization Authorities secretly asked several seasoned Ets'aalin Hives to have them emigrate to Aimaa.

The initial population was made of experienced hived danebs already striving in Baartish colonies, along with veteran colonists from k'rinn worlds. As a diplomatic token present from Ka'Ralt to the Council, the Secession even participed by providing the co-colony with a contingent of enduring volunteers.

Whether from Council or Secession, every K'Rinn volunteering for Aimaa has to be willing to live in a potentially dangerous environment, even protected from young sshaads packs by shapeshifter controllers.
