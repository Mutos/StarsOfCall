  <description>This station was founded by independent spacerithai and -men in the wake of the Fringe Wars, in a system that was called "Althaim", meaning "The crossing" in Irilia. They wanted to built a place where any sentient could come and go freely, to learn the ways of other people and trade any possible goods.

On a major route on the Irilia-Alliance border and near the Gham Garri stronghold at Irilia-4, it has been challenged on several occasions. Each time, spacers all around have assembled in defiance against the threats.
