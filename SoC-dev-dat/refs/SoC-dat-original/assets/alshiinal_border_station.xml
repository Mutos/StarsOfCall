  <description>This station guards the sshaad side of the route between the Candidate Systems and the Purple Trail, and doubles as a trading post between the two States.

First contact of Baartish explorers with non-Sshaads occurred on the rith side, with the opening of the Long Link to Arythem space. But despite the Baartish's display of will to enter the Community, this never occurred. Then, on the other side of the Sshaad Sphere, a jump route was discovered to the Human Sphere.

Alshiinal's initial purpose was to prevent incursion of sshaad pirates into human systems, as despite the Candidate System's strict embargo on piracy, some groups still thrive in Candidate space. Although there are few human pirates from the Purple Trail, a concerning flow of smuggling is rising and has to be curbed.
