  <description>A trading station built by independant merchants between the Villera, Banthory, Ziffel and Nyotekundu systems, and only 8 jumps from Sol. The original backers renamed the system "The Hub" for advertising and excavated a small asteroid to make a terrarium station. It offers ample zeegee docking space and one centrifuge ring at either end of its axis, to provide gravity quarters for travellers.

When construction was under work, a Stellar Police enquiry led by Vladimir Igorovitch Demeniev revealed that behind the official backers stood a local mafia concern. The station was to be a cover for an organs traficking network in this remote sector of the Core League. Construction halted during one full year and resumed when funding was secured with a new round, this time heavily screened by the authorities.

Freeport 4's position has indeed be well chosen and it thrived on commerce between the 3 colony worlds, the Nyotekundu mining system and Sol. Now it has become the meeting point in this sector of space. It is also used as a Stellar Police base and a Core League rear base near the Shoden border.
