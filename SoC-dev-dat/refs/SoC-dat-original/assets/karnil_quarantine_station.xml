  <description>This quarantine station ensures only authorized personnel gets to the ground of Arythem-5 and moreover, that not one Na'imsh egg can ever leave the planet.

It had originally been established as a full staging habitat, allowing the colonists to live several weeks before planetfall, and ready to become a trade asset on the then-quickly growing network of Arythem systems.

After the tragedy struck the planetside settlements, the station was hastily converted into the quarantine facility it is still now. It has since grown a little, but the embargo will prevent it forever from becoming a major trade point.
