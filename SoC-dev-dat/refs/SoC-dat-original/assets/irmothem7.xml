  <description>Irmothem-7 is one of the last settled worlds of the Clan. It has a barren surface with some seas and great deserts. Just as Irmothem-6, it possesses an underground water cycle, but it is fuelled by a rich waterbed coming directly from the seas rather than rivers flowing from moutains.

Many colonists indeed come from Irmothem-6 and, as the new world is quite ore-rich, it is viewed as a valuable asset in Irmothem's pouch. However, as it is near Arythem space, there is always concern about a possible border conflict.
