  <description>This small Bernal Sphere was a tentative settlement on the fringes of the Core League. it was used as a foothold during the 2245 attempt to create a mafia-state on the borders of the Human Sphere. Now it's just another habitat, more closely monitored than others by the Stellar Police.
