  <description>The twin station to Freiheit Tueren, this habitat has been used as a door between the Delta Sector and the Raumbahn Sieben jump route.

It is now maintained by the Stellar Police and prevents smuggling from the Ashioto and Delta Sector Cluster to the Core League's Villera Sector. It also acts as a trading station at the end of the now official Raumbahn Sieben route.</description>
