  <description>During the Corporate Wars, this stealth station hidden in planet Wai's rings was a crucial part of the Alliance EWS on the backside jump route from Sol to Sanctuary.

After the war and with the Shadow Complex becoming a State in its own right, border duty was transferred forward to the newly built Ryuu Station. Thus, the old outpost was bought by a successful merchant named Angelique Devereau and converted to a minor trading and smuggling station.

Later on, a jump route was discovered to the Baartish Intersystems. The Devereau Movers jumped on the market and thrived on it, along with their home station, which became a major Planetarist border trade node.
