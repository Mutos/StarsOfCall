  <description>Mars was the first world to be colonized by the human species, in its very first century of space exploration. Domed cities were established first, with t-farms for cultivating terraforming bacteria. The terraforming process itself took nearly a century and never turned Mars into a green planet as Earth, but mae it a semi-desertic world quite akin to what Irilia is naturally.

Mars has always been left in shadows by the proximity of Earth. It is nonetheless a powerful planet and one of the major worlds on the Human Sphere.
