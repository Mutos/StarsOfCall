  <description>This cold yet rich world was the second sublight colony of the Irmothem Clan. It was later linked to Irmothem itself by a jump route, which from then on became a major artery of the Clan's space.

From it departed many expeditions to settle new planets a few jumps beyond, or surround them with dual-counter-rotating habitats. In this, the Irmothem differed greatly from the other major Clans, who never established so many stations, preferring to only settle already living planets.
