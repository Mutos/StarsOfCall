  <description>Tshiaa'rsh is the Sshaads' cradleworld. It is one of the few major worlds ruled by the "Daneb Anarchs", whose ideology is based on the sociological theory that, since the beginning of the industrial age, Masters Leagues have perverted the near-anarchy of the ancestral villages, known as "daneb".

By now, it has lost most of its political power as a state in itself and is formally allied to Baartish Intersystems, but has retained a government, based on an alliance of the planet's danebs. The planet is quite jealous of its independance from the Baartish Masters, which has led it welcome the headquarters of the Daneb Anarchs.

In popular culture, it is often opposed to the Baartish capitol, where the ruling Masters gather. A common saying tells that "Baartish rules by its Masters' networks, Tshiaa'rsh rules by its people's brains". It is renowned for being the place where different cultures and ideas meet and ground-breaking policies are decided.
