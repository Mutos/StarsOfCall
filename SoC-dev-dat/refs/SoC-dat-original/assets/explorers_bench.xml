  <description>Orbiting a spectacular gas giant named The Eye, this aquarium station was once the main staging ground for exploration in the Independent Stars. Now that it's no more on the fringes of explored sectors, this role has waned somehow.

It is still a breeding station for marine-derived exploration ships, famous for its vast aquaria and reconstituted ecosystems. It has even begun to become a popular touristic destination, despite its remote situation and the uncompromising Independent Stars policy towards non-symbiotic sentients.
