  <description>This station, named after an Arythem word describing an outpost on a distant island, is spacers' declination of the K'Til'n concept, implemented by the Shadow Complex.

It features regular, paying services like fuel and a mission computer, but also an "offerings hold" for visiting ships to leave non-perishable supplies for further use by crews in dire need.
