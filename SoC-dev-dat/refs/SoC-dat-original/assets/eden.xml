  <description>A lush paradise orbiting a spectacular gas giant named "Utsukushi", the Japanese word for "beautiful", Eden is the only largely colonized planet in the Hoshi no Hekka and is a legend in its own right among Spacers.

Originally from fear of having a "gravvies attitude" spoil the HnH's ideological foundation, the Council of the Hekka keeps picturing Eden as a kind of "Turtle Island in space", an idyllic resort when only true Spacers can land. This allows them to keep planetside permanent residents to a bare minimum, but also helps attract tourists and thus traffic and trade.

The planet and the entire system are fiercely protected by all HnH people. There is always at least two Fortresses patrolling the Eden system, all non-HnH ships are required to register on Eden High before proceeding to the planet and permanent residency visas are very sparingly issued.
