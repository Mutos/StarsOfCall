  <description>The sixth Irilia colony links the first two arms of Irilia extension. It's another water-rich world, colonized by an expedition comprised of nearly only Irilia-5 natives, it has always maintained strong ties with its parent world.

As native pseudo-whales were discovered to be semi-sentient, Pupeteer help was asked for to communicate with them. That's how a small settlement was installed by 13-Planets League people from Colony 10. Located in a subtropical oceania, it is becoming the planet's main touristic asset, but its access is severely restricted to protect it, as it is also the main habitat of the pseudo-whales.
