  <description>Ghilan's Pride is a 1st-generation K'Til'n station due to be dismantled, that was bought by a human spacer and towed into place around Light of Dawn, ten jumps away from its original system, after a sternuous journey.

It mainly serves as a refueling relay, its minimal crew operating automated harvesters to get fuel at low-cost from the gas giant's atmosphere.
