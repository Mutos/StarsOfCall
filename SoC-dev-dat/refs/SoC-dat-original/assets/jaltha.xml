  <description>This planet evenly split between water and barren deserts has next to no ground life, but its small native ecosystems mostly grow on the oceans. It was colonized as a mining resource and has since grown far above the outpost status. Despite the proximity to the Long Link, a once proposed plan for a rith-shaad co-colony has been discouraged by the planetside authorities.

Among Long Link travellers, Jaltha is rumored to be a staging ground for xenophobic and anti-Adrim movements inside the Arythem Clan. The planet is under scrutiny by the Joint Peacekeeper Force and, as a result, traffic in the system is heavily scanned for Jenac or Gham Garri smugglers or activists.
