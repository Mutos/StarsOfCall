  <description>The latest station built by the Purple Trail, this asteroid platform guards the State's side of the jump to the Candidate Systems border, completing a cluster of small outposts already scattered in the system.

It is by this route that Humans and Sshaads came first into contact and it has long been a contended sector, before the Candidate Systems formed to enter the Commonwealth and came to a truce with the Purple Trail. Now the two States are allies and the station is manned by a mixed crew.

Its basic role is to protect the route from piracy, along with Alshiinal station on the Candidate Systems side, as stated in the agreements between the two States.
