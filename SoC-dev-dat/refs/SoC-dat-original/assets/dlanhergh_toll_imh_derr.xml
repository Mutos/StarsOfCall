  <description>Founded by exfiltrated Adrim Thrull dri'h Dlanhergh, one of the first to use "dri'h" as a honorific, the station is a small spaceship repair dock where many outfits ("toll" in Irilia) and weapons ("derr" in Irilia) are available. It is also a stopping point for Free Adrimai ships travelling through Planetarist space from the Irilia sector.

From time to time, a daring Free Adrim passes by the station on their route to join the Aragwedyr Clan on Amarynn-Woodsfield, only 2 jumps away. These ones get discount prices on personnal equipment and an introduction for Clan officials, as Thrull's heirs are always ready to help a fellow Adrim regain honor.

The station is considered by the Free Adrimai as a tribe of its own, but most official Clans in the Rith Sphere frown on its existence.
