  <description>This small independent shipyard was originally a trading station that got bankrupt, and whose hulk was left rotting for years. It finally happened to be bought by a pair of spaceship mechanics, who had travelled some years around known space and gathered a small, but gifted crew around them.

In a few years, it became known as a must-go for anyone wanting a custom ship tailored to even the most extreme specifications. You can only find good quality material here, not the junk 'sold' in many other spaceyards.

Due to the many connections of the station's owners, it is always well-stocked in anything that can be sold or bought in the known universe.
