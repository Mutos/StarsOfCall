  <description>Sheng Station is named after Sheng Li Fong, the Commander of the "Purple Flag" supercruiser, that carried the Cartel Sol top-brass out of the Sol system to flee the Planetarist invasion and founded the Purple Trail.

When the station was built, this naming had been perceived as a gesture of defiance againts the Planetarist Alliance. As it's on the shortest route from the Purple Trail to Sol, it is manned by elite squadrons and backed full-time by an insystem patrol fleet.
