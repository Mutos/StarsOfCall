  <description>This station is one of the main research shipyards within Shoden space. It borders the small Relat cluster, whose uninhabited systems are used as proving grounds for new ships and weapons.

It is also said that the stealth station over Banthory IV, that later became Beuzelay-la-Bastille, was a research plan stemming from Rarilash, but that has never been confirmed. Rumours tell of a power struggle between high ranking masters, that ended with the withdrawal of funding for the Banthory project.
