  <description>This station guards the Alliance space on its Irilia border. It has been built when the route to Irilia-14 was discovered. At the time, some investors gambled on the fact it would develop far beyond the military outpost the Alliance intended to build. But as Irilia-14 can hardly accomodate more population, the main trade remained of raw ores from its rich crust, and the station never developped.
