  <description>Ets'aalin is a lush world, which was chosen for colonization rather than Aimaa by the Hash'riss Colonization Corporation for political reasons, deliberately ignoring the low biocompatibility reports.

At that time, Baartish space was split on the Complementarity question and, just before the expedition was launched, Hash'riss hierarchy sided with the anti-Complementarists. Some already planned hived danebs were cancelled, but some Sshaads colonists decided to sneak in their fellow Shapeshifters. A few Hives, fearing to live underground, resigned and many of their members had to join other Hives to stay in the expedition.

After a few years underground, as Baartish sided with the Complementarists, the planet was expunged of Shoden forces. Meantime, the complementarist colonists and the Shoden have fought a dirty war of ambushes, underground actions and raids. This resulted in several tragedies, including the well-known odyssey of Three-Willows, the young Shapeshifter envoy who crashed with a Core League shuttle while chased by Shoden forces.

After the nearby Aimaa planet was settled as a co-colony with the K'Rinns, its good biocompatibility made it more attractive than Ets'aalin. The planetary authorities sought to turn their lush world into a kind of pleasure resort using its magnificent vistas and lush forest areas, but until now, Ets'aalin is still quite backyards.
