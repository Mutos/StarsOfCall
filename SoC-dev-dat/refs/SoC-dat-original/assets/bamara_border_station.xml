  <description>Bamara has been built as an outpost for epxloiting the Neufeld Asteroids Field. After a few months, seemingly sshaad ships jumped in from an uncharted jump point and an attempt to take over Bamara was repelled. A Core Navy Fleet visiting Nyotekundu was rerouted and the outpost was turned into a military base.

Explorers were sent through the jump point. They never returned, but sent message drones with images of a small fleet bearing Shoden markings. After a while, Shoden ships began pouring in from the jump point. The invasion fleet was finally routed. Once reinforcements came, a counter-attack was launched, that broke on a stronger fleet than expected. Each side understing the other side was too hard a nut to break, the High Master in charge of Baatal and the Fleet Admiral commanding Bamara negociated a non-aggression treaty over the route.

What is now known as the Baatal-Bamara Incident started a "mild peace blockade". Patrols from Bamara and its Shoden shadow, Baatal, routinely cruise the two buffer systems between them, and a full Core Navy Home Fleet routinely patrols the systems between Bamara, Nyotekundu and Hammerfall. The station is regaining its role as a trading outpost as daring human and sshaad captains seek profit from the border. A small smuggling flow has even been reported, despite the heavy patrol presence.

Ships willing to land on Bamara need a military accreditation from the Core League.
