  <description>High Reaches is a quite small planet orbiting a very spectacular red gas giant. Its exotic indigenous life, with very low biocompatibility with all other known lifeforms, is a very interesting subject for League scientists. And Pupeteers being what they are, science is a path that attracts many people. So, despite harsh living conditions, High Reaches study missions gather many candidates.
