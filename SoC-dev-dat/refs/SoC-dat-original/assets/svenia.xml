  <description>This lush world on the border of Read Quadrant League and Thirteen Planets, originately settled by Pupeteers, has developed a multi-species colony with a Spacer-inspired culture. Its good if not excellent biocompatibility and the existence of many species well suited to become bearers earned it fame quite early.

It is a favorite among Spacers as a haven of peace, as it willingly removed itself from the turmoil of interstellar politics. It is also known as a quite active local trade hub.
