  <description>The Pupeteers' cradleworld is a lush world, which has been named with the local world meaning "soil". It is often designated as "Pupeteers' Earth" in whatever language the map you're reading is written - here, Terranglo. It is also colloquially known as "The Cradle", from its stellar system's most used name.

The system itself is remarkable with its one-jump exit, that slowed the Pupeteers' initial access to the hyperspace technology, as its discovery occurred only centuries after the system was fully explored and colonized.
