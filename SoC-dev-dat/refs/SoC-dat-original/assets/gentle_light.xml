  <description>This station is of a class known as "Life Shell", roughly the equivalent to the k'rinn K'Til'n outposts, but with a small crew.

It features a fuel depot refilled by several asteroids-mining drones, and a mission computer. A small bar entertains the crew and the passing travellers.
  </description>
  <bar>A few Spacers kill time by discussing with the crew while their ships is being refuelled.</bar>
