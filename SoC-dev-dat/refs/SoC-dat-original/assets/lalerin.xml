  <description>Lalerin is a small mainly oceanic moon around a gas giant. Its continents are green with vast forests suitable for sshaad life and its oceans are full of very lively ecosystems, all with a good biocompatibility to sshaad-like life.

It has been colonized by a small party of Daneb Anarchs who choose to settle planetside. Their initially open-minded culture made them eager to join the Candidate Systems when the new State was born.

The planet has always had contacts with other sentients and has evolved into a reputable leisure resort, despite poor biocompatibility to their nearest neighbours, the Humans and K'Rinns of the Shadow Complex.
