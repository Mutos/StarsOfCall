  <description>This unk'rinned station, as all of the K'Til'n class, is little more than a structure with a few docking stations, a fuel hold and a mission computer, served by a semi-AI.

As all traditionnal stations and most newer do, it has a "free offers hold" where passing ships leave and take free supplies.
