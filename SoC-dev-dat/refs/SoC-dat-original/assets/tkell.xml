  <description>This station was built as soon as the jump tunnel leading to the Rith Core, unknown at the time of the Fringe Wars, was discovered.

It is k'rinned with the elitemost pilots in the Secession fleet and always has a small anti-fleet force at the ready. It conducts routine patrols on the nearby frontier system, as part of a border agreement with the Kemae, in which every side tolerates the other's patrols.
