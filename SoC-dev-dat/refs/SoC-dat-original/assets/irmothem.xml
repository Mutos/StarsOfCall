  <description>The first extradromal world colonized by the Rithai was settled by plasma-driven sleeper ships built by the Irmothem Orbital Shipyards. This expedition prompted the Arythem-Irmothem "race for the stars" that took place just after the birth of the Irilia Clan.

From  the very beginning, this lush planet has been seen as a second home to the Irmothem Clan. It was the first truly Irmothem world, free from Arythem presence. It has soon been renamed simply Irmothem, instead of the customary Irmothem-1. A noria of torchships has always been maintained wih the rith homeworld and the first hyperspace expedition launched by the Clan was aimed at finding a route to link it to Drom. In fact, it actually found two parallel routes.

This history explains why Irmothem has a high population and a level of development nearly equal to Skarae itself. It owes its prosperity to its use as a staging area for all interstellar commerce on the whole Irmothem space.
