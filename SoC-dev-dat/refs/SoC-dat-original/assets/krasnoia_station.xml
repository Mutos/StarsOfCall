  <description>The older asteroids ore trading center in the system, this station was never converted to a Fortress. Its position on the edge of a rich Asteroids Field and between the two main jump points explained its success. It is still a major trading center, despite the nearby presence of Hallier and Engelstadt in the system. In fact, it has been one of the reasons that prompted Urs Schreiber to built Engelstadt Station in this very system.
