  <description>Talking Waves took its name from its proteiform ocean life, that seems to pass from a shape to another with not much logic, and whose higher species are thought to be near-sentient.

The local searchers have formally requested the help of Shapeshifters to study than peculiar fauna, as shapeshifting seem to be a defining feature of most of its species. As of now, only a few Hives answered the call, but the movement is expected to grow.

  <bar>Mainly researchers in biology and sentience, along with a few local people on bearers. With luck, you could spot a group of Shapeshifters</bar>
