  <description>A lush oceanic planet with forests on the continents, Ssaalin is a perfect world for the Sshaads. Its biocompatibility is one of the highest ever found, as it is nearly 90% biocompatible with all known ecosystems. Furthermore, the sight of Ershell in the sky makes Ssaalin a renowned touristic place.

After the first hived daneb ever, the Irshiinal Hive, was destroyed while trying to leave Tshiaa'rint under heavy Shoden fire, its remnants were settled on Ssaalin in the faint hope that another Hive could restore the original soul's memory backups. This never happened, but gave the planet a legendary status amond Complementarists. It now counts a few thousands hived danebs, totalling nearly a million souls and speaking a peculiar cross between the Toshic and Baartish tongues.
