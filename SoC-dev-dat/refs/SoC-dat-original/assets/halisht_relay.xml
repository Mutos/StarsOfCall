  <description>This relay is the prototype of the well-known Halisht-class stations. It was built as a staging place by Irilia explorers enroute to what would become the Irilia Core. When they eventually stumbled on Irilia-1 and discovered what would be Irilia-5 and Irilia-8, the relay became an obliged waypoint on Irilia space.

The station's design is quite crude, being basically a large cube with docking ports, solar arrays and massive fuel tanks, fit for the spaceships of the time, that were much more fuel-hungry than today.

  <bar>A few Irilia are there to see a landmark of space exploration, along with the usual motley crew of traders, Spacers and station personnel.</bar>
