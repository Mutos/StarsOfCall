  <description>This is a hardpoint-mounted version of the Standard Jammer. Unlike general purpose scrambler systems, jammers are heavy-duty pieces of hardware used for serious electronic warfare in space. A jammer works by actively interfering with nearby ships' sensor systems, rather than modulating the signature of the ship it's installed in. This is much more effective, but it also uses a lot more power. For this reason, jammer systems are inactive until needed, and must be activated manually.</description>
