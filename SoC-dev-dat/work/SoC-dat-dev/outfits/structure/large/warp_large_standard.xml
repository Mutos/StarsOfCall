 <specific type="modification">
  <thrust>150</thrust>							<!-- Main purpose	: thrust directs acceleration -->
  <speed>200</speed>							<!-- Main purpose	: maximum absolute speed - unrealistic but needed ! -->
  <misc_reverse_thrust>1</misc_reverse_thrust>	<!-- Main purpose	: allows the ship to decelerate as well as accelerate, albeit with less power -->
  <energy_usage>36</energy_usage>				<!-- Energy cost	: defines energy consumption -->
  <engine_limit>10000</engine_limit>			<!-- Mass Limit		: engine is less efficient for ships past that limit -->
  <mass_rel>50</mass_rel>						<!-- Mass cost		: the verniers array is not the heaviest outfit, but it certainly adds to a ship's mass -->
