  <thrust>250</thrust>							<!-- Main purpose	: thrust directs acceleration -->
  <speed>300</speed>							<!-- Main purpose	: maximum absolute speed - unrealistic but needed ! -->
  <misc_reverse_thrust>1</misc_reverse_thrust>	<!-- Main purpose	: allows the ship to decelerate as well as accelerate, albeit with less power -->
  <engine_limit>400</engine_limit>				<!-- Mass Limit		: engine is less efficient for ships past that limit -->
