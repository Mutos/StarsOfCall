  <description>Warp overrides are like afterburners, but on warp engines. They provide your ship with an immediate boost to thrust and speed when activated. However, as they use extra high energy fields to stabilize the warp effect beyond what woud normally be possible, they will steadily drain the ship's energy and also generate heat. If the override gets too hot, its effect will diminish, and eventually it will shut off entirely.</description>
