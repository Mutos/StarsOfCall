  <description>Falas is a sparsely populated garrison planet with little to no resources of any use. However, it was cheaper to build an outpost here than to build a whole new space station. Being located in a relatively safe area of Empire space, there are not many things to do, with most of the problems being caused by personnel bored out of their minds.</description>
  <bar>The bar is host to several off-duty personnel. There aren't many of them here and the bar is mostly empty.</bar>
