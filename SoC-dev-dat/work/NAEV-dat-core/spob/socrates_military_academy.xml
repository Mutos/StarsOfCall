  <description>The Socrates Military Academy is where the highest ranking military officers in the Sirian fleet are trained. The facility is predominantly populated by Serra echelon Sirii, with a minority of Fyrra echelon Sirii mixed in. In this facility the students learn do command fleets, win military engagements and represent the interests of House Sirius in diplomatic negotiations.</description>
  <bar>Many students are seen studying here at the spaceport bar. Being accepted here is a feat in itself, and only top-notch performance is accepted by the teachers. Needless to say, most students have little time for social pleasantries.</bar>
