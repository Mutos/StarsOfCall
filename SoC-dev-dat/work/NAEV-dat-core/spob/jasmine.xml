  <description>Once, Jasmine was a dead-end world in a dusty corner of Soromid space. But with the fairly recent discovery of the Gewirn-Point Zero jump traffic through the Gewirn system has increased, giving Jasmine an economic breath of fresh air. That said, Jasmine is little more than a stopover point to most spacers.</description>
  <bar>This bar is a short walk from the spaceport, which itself is little more than a collection of crude pits in the ground that contain the bare essentials needed to service landed ships. Jasmine was never rich enough to afford a serious space port, and this does not seem likely to change.</bar>
