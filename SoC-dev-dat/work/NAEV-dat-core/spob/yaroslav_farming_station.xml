  <description>This farming facility provides the nearby systems with food. Some of the produce is shipped to the nearby world of Boowoy, but the majority is traded out of system.</description>
  <bar>Most visitors to this spaceport bar are here for the same reason. They want to buy food so they can sell it at a planet that imports it for a profit. Some merchants time their purchase right after one of the harvests that happen once every dozen decaperiods or so to get the lowest prices possible.</bar>
