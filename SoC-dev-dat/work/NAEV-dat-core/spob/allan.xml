  <description>Allan was once a patrol station sent out to patrol the southern reaches of space. With the Incident and the regression of Imperial power, Allan was left behind. It is now barely maintained by a small contingent of Dvaered soldiers and engineers for the use of traders.</description>
  <bar>Allan does not have the resources for much but the bar looks decent enough, with clean facilities, decent food and strong drink. For its patrons it provides a small respite from the harsh galaxy.</bar>
