  <description>Almost true to its name Sorrow II is a sad planet designated as the House Sirius waste disposal facility by the whims of an Arch-Canter. Although at one point there was a small manned station that allowed for refueling. It has long since been abandoned and is treated as a dump location for toxic materials brought from throughout the House Sirius territories.</description>
