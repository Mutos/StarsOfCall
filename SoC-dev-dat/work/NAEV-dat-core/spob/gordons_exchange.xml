  <description>Gordon's Exchange is one of the few stations owned and operated by traders. It is here that most of the deals are made and ore shipped. It is a bustling, modern facility, and there are always things for weary traveller to do.</description>
  <bar>The bar has some classy music playing in the background over the chatter of businessmen going about their jobs. The sounds of a modern economy.</bar>
