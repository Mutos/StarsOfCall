  <description>The Sirii have a rather extensive military infrastructure within their borders and Fyruse Station is part of that infrastructure. There's a regular detachment stationed here, making sure that law and order are maintained as well as can reasonably be expected in Esker and its neighbouring systems. Fyruse Station also acts as a border guard for Frontier space, though nobody really believes in the need for such.</description>
  <bar>As Fyruse Station is a Sirius-only facility, the bar is divided into three sections, one for each echelon. In the rare event that a non-Sirius visitor is allowed on board, they are catered for in the Shaira section.</bar>
