  <description>Through long-honed craftsmanship, pirate software engineers are able to create near perfect replicas of the Heavy Weapon License. However, this comes at a significant mark-up compared to the standard license prices. This license will authorize you to buy and use heavy weapons, like the heavy ion turret, on worlds that perform background checks.</description>
