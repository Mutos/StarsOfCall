  <description>No one really knows the origin of the camouflage burster, however, it seems to have been derived from a more primitive makeshift version used but smugglers to evade patrols. By emitting a barrage of strong signals, it is able to temporarily confuse the sensors of nearby ships and give a significant increase in stealth ability. However, this is only a short temporary effect, and the device takes a long time to recalibrate and load the capacitors.</description>
  <desc_extra>8 second duration with 30 second cooldown. Will not activate if the ship is unable to stealth with the bonus.</desc_extra>
