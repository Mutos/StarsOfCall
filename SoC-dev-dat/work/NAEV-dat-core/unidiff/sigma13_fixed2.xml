  <description>The small research station has had minimal services restored to it, although it is far from working at full power. Large plasma scars over the hull give indication of the traumatic happenings in the station's recent past. There also seem to be large bite marks around the shipyard, and especially the fuel tanks, which is now minimally operational.</description>
  <bar>What passes for the spaceport bar is a simple room labelled "Storage Room 18" with "Mie's Friendly Bar!" written on top. Inside you find all sorts of weird beverages stored in beaker tubes and other scientific equipment. Like the rest of the station, it is quite a mess with old research papers littering the floor. However, it is not bad by Za'lek standards.</bar>
