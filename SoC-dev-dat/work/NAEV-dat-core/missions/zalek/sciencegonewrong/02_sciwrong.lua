   Mission: The one with the Runaway
   Description: A prototype drone runs away and needs to be caught by the player
   How to make this more interesting than just go to a system and shoot down the drone w ion or medusa? The ship has to have enough cargo for the drone to be transported back.
   So the player has to hail the drone bc the scientist wants to patch the software which fails and the drone causes other drones to attack.
   I was thinking of player having to use electronic warfare. But is there a way to check that?
   Difficulty: relatively easy?
