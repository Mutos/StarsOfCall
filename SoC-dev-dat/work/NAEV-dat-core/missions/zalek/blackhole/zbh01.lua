Knowing you won't be of help, you wait at the docks wondering how long it'll take him, and begin to nod off.]]))

I'll start seeing if I can figure out what happened to this station and what exactly they were researching. I'm afraid I'm currently in the dark and don't really know much about the details. If you want to help, you should be able to find me around the station while I finish up the repairs. I might have things for you to help with."]]))
