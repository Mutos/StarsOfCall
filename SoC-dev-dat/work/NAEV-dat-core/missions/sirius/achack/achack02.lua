I think our friend Harja still has it in for me. You had the common sense to use your head, but I'm afraid not everyone is like that. I'm convinced Harja will try to hire more assassins to do what you didn't, so I'm in considerable danger."

I've had combat training, of course, just like every other Serra soldier, but I'm afraid I have little actual fighting experience, and I'm not sure I could survive an attack unassisted. You, however, seem to have seen quite some action. If you were to escort me while I make my rounds, I would feel a lot more secure. I can reward you, of course. Let's see...

Now that you have agreed to be my personal escort, I can give you clearance to dock with those bases if you don't have it already so you can automatically refuel, but either way I won't be on station long, so you won't have time to disembark and do other things while you're there.
    "Also, I think this goes without saying, but I need you to stick close to me so your ship must be fast enough. Also don't jump to any systems before I do, don't jump to the wrong systems, and don't land on any planets I don't land on. If we meet any aggressors along the way I will rely on you to help me fight them off. That's about it. I'll finish up a few things here, and then I'll head to my ship.

It's a very prestigious place among us Sirii, as you may or may not know. It's only one jump away from Mutris itself and... Well, anyway, it's one of the best academies in all of Sirius space, and only the most capable students are allowed to attend. Now, I don't mean to brag, you understand, but even in that environment I was among the top rated students. And, believe it or not, so was Harja. We were in the same study unit, actually.
    "Another thing you should know is that the High Academy offers the very best among its students the chance to advance to the Serra echelon. You're not Sirian so you might not understand, but it's an exceptional honor for those born into the Shaira or Fyrra echelons to rise to a higher echelon. It's extremely valuable to us. So you see, the prospect of being rewarded like that is a very strong motivation for most of the students. It was no different for Harja and myself, since we were both Fyrra echelon. With our abilities, each of us had a good chance of earning the promotion. However, since we were in the same study unit, only one of us could be promoted; only one promotion is awarded per study unit each curriculum. That meant that Harja and I were rivals, but we were good-natured rivals. We each had every intention of winning the promotion through fair competition... Or so I thought."]]))

There had been a security breach in the academy's main computer. Someone had hacked the system and altered the data for the final exams, mine to be exact. My grades had been altered to be straight one hundred percent, in every subject. Can you believe that? Someone had actually tried to make it look like I was cheating. What were they thinking? The academy staff wasn't fooled for even a moment. Nobody would be reckless enough to alter their own scores that way, so the only reason my scores would have been altered is if someone else did it, no doubt in order to discredit me. And you guessed it, the prime suspect was Harja. After all, if I was disqualified, he would certainly have gotten the promotion. Instead, he got what he deserved, and was expelled for his unethical attempt to secure his own success."
    "That's basically the history between me and Harja. Up until you came to me, I just thought of him as an untrustworthy man whose own underhanded plan backfired on him. But here we are, cycles later, and now he's trying to kill me. Why, I wonder? Could he really be so bitter over what happened that he wants me dead? Even though he has nobody to blame but himself? I just don't understand it, {player}, I really don't."
    Joanne remains silent for a moment, then takes a deep breath. "Whew, I feel quite a bit better now for having told this to you. Thanks for listening, it means a lot to me. I shouldn't keep you here any longer though, I'm sure you have a lot of other problems to look after."
