    You take another look at the thing. It resembles a small flat surface, apart from the crook at one end. On one side, there are cylindrical, solid protrusions that don't seem to serve any useful purpose at all. You are at a loss as to the artefact's purpose.
    "It's called a skate-board," Flintley continues. "The records about it are a bit sketchy and a lot is nothing but conjecture, but it appears it was once used in primitive communal rituals. The exact nature of these rituals is unknown, but they may have been tribal initiations or even mating rituals. The patterns in the board itself are thought to have a spiritual or mystical meaning. Also, according to some theories, people used to stand on top of the skate-board, with the cylinder wheels facing the ground. This has led some historians to believe that the feet were once central to human psychology."
