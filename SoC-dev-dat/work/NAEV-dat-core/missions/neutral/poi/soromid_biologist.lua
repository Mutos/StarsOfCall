I found an interesting rumour today while visiting the bar at Neurri. I was told that, although most bioships are completely domesticated, with little in the ways of autonomy and higher level cognition, it seems like this is not always the case. Some times the bioships can end up too smart for their own good. What happens to them depends on the tribe in this case, but it is not uncommon for them to go missing. This is very interesting and could be related to my research. I am going to try to see if I can find any more information on the topic.]]))

After fruitless leads, I have arrived to Silverstone in the Symm system and have been talking with the bioship producers. They seem to reject the notion of "feral" bioships. I was almost about to call it quits and return home, when I managed to talk to a younger employee who sees to confirm my suspicions. Indeed, although rare, some times random mutations in the DNA can lead to not fully controllable bioships. They swear that they are as cunning and intelligent as humans. The future of such ships is uncertain, but they can be taken away or escape. However, only the tribe elders deal with such bioships. It seems like most head towards the Haze, and that is the next place I must travel to. For this trip I will leave behind my trusty Koala and go with a Soromid Brigand. This may arouse less suspicion should I happen upon feral bioships.]]))
